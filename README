Version 0.03;

Notice: Work in progress and inappropriate for human consumption.

-------------------------

This is far from finished and I apologize for its lack of
completeness.  This will be rectified over time.  Hopefully
it is useful nonetheless.

UPDATE: HEADER COMPRESSION IS SIMPLY BROKEN.  It will work
in some cases, but far from all.

This is not a complete implementation of Draft-04 of HTTP/2.0.
The expectation is this will evolve in the near future to approach
completeness.

Look at the usage in http2client.pl and http2server.pl for examples.

--------------------------

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

--------------------------

This bundle provides a number of libraries intended to
provide the basic necessities for an HTTP/2.0 implementation.
The modules currently are as follows.

HTTP2::Draft

Base module that provide a namespace and basic functionality

HTTP2::Draft::Log

Provides a wrapper for Log::Log4perl;

HTTP2::Draft::Compress
HTTP2::Draft::HeaderIndex

Modules for the implementation of the header compression spec.

HTTP2::Draft::Stream
HTTP2::Draft::Connection
HTTP2::Draft::Frame

Connection, Frame, and stream implementation.  Most of the heavy
lifting occurs in Connection.  Each Frame has a sub class in
Frame.pm

HTTP2::Draft::Server
HTTP2::Draft::Client

An attempt to wrap the above code in a module to make Server and
Client implementations simple.

IO::Async::HTTP2::Framer
IO::Async::HTTP2::FramerStream

IO::Async modules for reading and writing HTTP/2.0 frames on the
wire.

--------------------------

Also included are two scripts that use Server.pm and Client.pm
to implements a client and server:

apps/http2client.pl
apps/http2server.pl

--------------------------

Example:

From the ./apps directory:

perl http2server.pl

This defaults to using port 8443.

perl http2client.pl http://127.0.0.1:8443

The client has a relatively rich set of command line options.
Use the -h option for details.
